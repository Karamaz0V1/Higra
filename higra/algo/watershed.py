        `Watershed cuts: minimum spanning forests, and the drop of water principle <https://hal-upec-upem.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00622410/document>`_.

    The watershed cut is represented by a labelisation of the graph vertices.

    This algorithm has a linear runtime complexity :math:`\mathcal{O}(n)` with :math:`n` the number of edges in the graph.

    """
    Seeded watershed cut on an edge weighted graph.
    Seeds are defined as integral vertex weights: vertices with non zero values are considered as seeds.
    The label of a vertex of the graph is then defined equal to the label of the closest seed in the edge weighted graph for the min-max distance.
    If several such seeds exist (eg. on a plateus between two seeds), an arbitrary and consistent choice is made.

    The algorithm ensures that each seed vertex with value :math:`v\geq 1` is included in a region of value :math:`v` of the result.
    This implies that if, for a given seed value :math:`v`, the set of seed vertices with value :math:`v` is not connected then the set of
    of vertices labeled with the value :math:`v` is not necessarily connected.

    This algorithm has a runtime complexity in :math:`\mathcal{O}(n \log n)` with :math:`n` the number of edges in the graph.
